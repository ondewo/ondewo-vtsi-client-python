``ClientConfig`` must not print its password or its certificate.

``@dataclass`` generates a ``__repr__`` that prints every field, so before this guard any caller
doing ``log.debug(f"...{config}")`` -- or any traceback carrying locals -- wrote the ROPC password
and the gRPC certificate to its logs in clear text. Downstream consumers really do log config
objects: a repository-wide sweep in ondewo-vtsi found this class among the leakers, alongside its
own.

The assertions are behavioural (build the object, read its ``repr``) rather than a source grep,
because a grep for ``__repr__`` passes just as well for a ``__repr__`` that prints the secret anyway.
